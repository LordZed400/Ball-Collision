# Ball Collision

Simple Collision detection using C Programming Language.  
A rectangular border is made using the `rectangle()` fucntion and the ball is made using the `circle()` function.  
The x and y coordinates of the ball is either increased or decreased in every frame to simulate movement and collision.  
  
Another function `kbhit()` native to Borland compilers is used, which checks whether the keyboard buffer is empty or not.  
This is used as the "Press any Key to Continue" event.
